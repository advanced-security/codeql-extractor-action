## Overview

[CodeQL Extractor Action][github] is a GitHub Action that allows you to specify a CodeQL extractor to be used in your workflows as an author of an Extractor.
This action is designed to be used in conjunction with the [CodeQL][CodeQL] analysis tool, which is a powerful static analysis tool that can be used to find vulnerabilities in your code.

> [!WARNING]
> This action downloads the extractor from the GitHub repository. Make sure to use a trusted repository, owner, and extractor.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Easy to use**: The action is designed to be simple and easy to integrate into your existing GitHub Actions workflows.
- **End-to-end workflow**: The action provides end-to-end workflow for extracting code from your repository and running CodeQL analysis.
- **Customizable**: The action allows you to customize the extraction process to fit your specific needs.

## Usage

```yml
- name: "CodeQL Extractor Action"
  uses: advanced-security/codeql-extractor-action@v0.0.11
  with:
    # Repository reference (e.g. "owner/repo", "owner/repo@ref")
    extractor: "advanced-security/codeql-extractor-iac"
    # [optional]: Language(s) used to verify the extractor
    languages: "iac"
    # [optional] Attest the authenticity of the extractor
    attestation: true
```

## Q&A

**Whats is an Extractor?**

A CodeQL extractor is a tool that extracts code from a repository and prepares it for analysis by the CodeQL engine. It is used to convert the code into a format that can be analyzed by CodeQL.

**How do I create an Extractor?**

To create an extractor, you need to create a GitHub repository that contains the extractor releases as an artifact / assest in a GitHub release.
The extractor should be a Tarball file that contains the compiled extractor and all other necessary files for the extractor to run.
